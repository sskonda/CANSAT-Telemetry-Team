# This is the folder for using the BNO055 sensor's magentometer to find magnetic north

## First Iteration
- Write code to find magnetic north
- Control the brightness of an LED using PWM signals from the PI pico

## Second Iteration
- Modify the first iteration code to work with a 360 degree servo motor
  - The Servo motor should point north at all times, taking input from th gyroscope to know which way it should adjust

## Third Iteration
- Modify the code so that it points the camera to the direction of magnetic north and keeps it there, adjusting for any movement by taking readings from the Gyroscope
